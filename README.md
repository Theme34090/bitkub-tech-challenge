## run
```
python main.py
```

transactions output is in transactions.txt in format hash, from, to, amount <br/>
balance output is in balance.txt in format address: balance <br/>
balance calculate from all incoming, outgoing transaction starting from input address <br/>
use breadth first search algorithm to traverse tree <br/>

### things to improve (if I have time)
- refractor duplicate code, into functions
- hide API key
- receive input via arguments instead of hardcoding
- reformat output to csv
